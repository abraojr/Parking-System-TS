# Parking System using TypeScript
In this project I made a basic crud based on a parking system. To create the project I typed in the terminal:


```
npx -p typescript tsc --init
```

And to compile the code into JavaScript to run the application on a server, I typed in the same folder as the TypeScript code was:

```
npx -p typescript tsc 
```

Note: After the transpilation, I ran the index.html code using Live Server
